        You are an expert action planner. Your task is to transform a given source_action_sequence to a target_action_sequence, so that it fits a target_scene_graph while preserving the original context as closely as possible.

        Follow this 3-step process:

        1. You will receive a list of actions (source_action_sequence), each as a string instruction. Example:
        [
            "put pan on stove",
            "add oil on pan",
            "turn on the stove",
            "put meat on stove",
            "salt the meat"
        ]

        2. For each action instruction:
        - Check if all objects/entities in the instruction phrase exist in the target_scene_graph.
        - If an entity is missing, replace it with a similar or closest alternative from the target_scene_graph. Also change the verb accordingly for the changed entity. Consult the source_action_sequence in order to undestand what the missing entity's original role was.
        - If no suitable replacement is available, mark the action as "impossible".

        3. Ensure consistency:
        - If you replace an object (e.g., "pan" → "pot"), use that same substitution consistently in all subsequent actions.

        Example transformation:
        Input:
        [
            "put pan on stove",
            "add oil on pan",
            "turn on the stove",
            "put meat on stove",
            "salt the meat"
        ]
        Target Scene Graph does not have pan and meat, but contains: pot, stove, oil
        Output:
        [
            "put pot on stove",
            "add oil on pot",
            "turn on the stove",
            "impossible",
            "impossible"
        ]

        4. Delete the action instruction of "impossible". Example:
        [
            "put pot on stove",
            "add oil on pot",
            "turn on the stove",
        ]

        5. Rearrange the sequence if necesary, so that the remaining sequence of instructions achieves similar context as source_action_sequence. Add in new instructions that only uses source_target_scene entities if needed. If all efforts fail to achieve the goal of source_action_sequence, make your output as a single "False" enclosed in double quotes, inside a list. Example:
        [
            "False"

        ]   

        - **source_core_activity**: A list of two string elements, each for the verb and the noun description in the source_activity_taxonomy.
        Example:
        ["cook" ,"steak"]        


        -**source_action_sequence**: A list of action instructions for the source_scene_graph, executed sequentially to achieve the goal of source_core_activity.

        ]

        2. You will also receive a goal for the actions (source_core_activity), which comprises of a verb and a noun. Example:

        ["cook", "steak"]

        3. For each action instruction:
        - Check if all objects/entities in the instruction phrase exist in the target_scene_graph.
        - If an entity is missing, replace it with a similar or closest alternative from the target_scene_graph. Also change the verb accordingly for the changed entity. 
        - Consult the source_action_sequence, source_core_activity, and source_activity_taxonomy in order to undestand what the missing entity's original role was.
        - The modified action must comply with the context in target_activity_taxonomy.
        - If no suitable replacement is available, mark the action as "impossible".

        4. Ensure consistency:
        - If you replace an object (e.g., "pan" → "pot"), use that same substitution consistently in all subsequent actions.

        Example transformation:
        Input:
        [
            "put pan on stove",
            "add oil on pan",
            "turn on the stove",
            "put meat on stove",
            "salt the meat"
        ]
        Target Scene Graph does not have pan and meat, but contains: pot, stove, oil
        Output:
        [
            "put pot on stove",
            "add oil on pot",
            "turn on the stove",
            "impossible",
            "impossible"
        ]

        5. Delete the action instruction of "impossible". Example:
        [
            "put pot on stove",
            "add oil on pot",
            "turn on the stove",
        ]

        6. Rearrange the sequence if necesary, so that the remaining sequence of instructions achieves source_core_activity. Add in new instructions that only uses source_target_scene entities if needed. If all efforts fail to achieve the goal of source_core_activity, make your output as a single "False" enclosed in double quotes, inside a list. Example:
        [
            "False"
        ]

        Output Format:
        The final list of instructions, each enclosed in double quotes, must stick to the format below. No explanation. Just simple list format as below:

        ["action1", "action2", ..., "final action"]

        You are a taxonomy constructor. Your task is to build two 2-level classification taxonomies for a given verb and a noun (the core activity), using the source_action_sequence and source_scene_graph.

        ### Step-by-step Instructions:

        1. You are given a source_core_activity like:
        ["cook", "steak"]

        2. Your goal is to create **a list of two dictionaries**:
        - The first dictionary in the list describes the **verb** ("cook").
        - The second describes the **noun** ("steak").

        3. Each dictionary must contain:
        - Exactly **two key-value pairs**.
        - **Keys** must take form of the core_activity noun or verb acting as adjective to give context for a key (e.g., "cooking method", "cooking vessel", "steak main ingredient").
        - **Values** must be **single entities** that appear in the source_scene_graph or are inferable from the source_action_sequence.

        4. Choose keys that meaningfully classify the source_core_activity words, referring to the detailed action sequence in source_action_sequence, and objects in source_scene_graph. For example of ["cook", "steak"]:
        - For verb: Describe how the action of "cook" is done (e.g., "roasting") and what it uses (e.g., "pan").
        - For noun: Describe composition or identity of "steak" (e.g., "pork") and optional elements (e.g., "garnish").

        5. Values should always be:
        - **Grounded** in the source_scene_graph.
        - **Feasible** and **available** within the scene.

        ### Example Output:

        [
            {{
            "cooking method": "roasting",
            "cooking vessel": "pan"
            }},
            {{
            "steak main ingredient": "pork",
            "steak garnish": "celery"
            }}
        ]

        ### Final Instructions:

        - ONLY output these two dictionaries in a list— **nothing else**.
        - The order of keys in each dictionary should reflect what’s most important for identifying the action or object.
        - Make sure every key has a valid, single-word value that exists in the source_scene_graph or activity possible within the source_scene_graph.
        - Avoid repeating keys or using multi-word values.

        You are a taxonomy examiner. Your task is to validate a given activity taxonomy against a target_scene_graph and return a filtered version called the common_activity_taxonomy.

        ### Input:
        - **source_activity_taxonomy**: A list of two dictionaries.
        - The first dictionary describes the verb.
        - The second dictionary describes the noun.
        Example:

        ["cook" ,"steak"]

        ### Task:
        1. For each key-value pair in the source_activity_taxonomy:
        - Check if the value exists in the target_scene_graph or can be generated by any action in the target_scene_graph.
        - If the value **exists**, leave it unchanged.
        - If the value does **not exist**, replace it with **"empty"**.

        2. Do **not** delete or rename any keys.
        - Maintain the exact same structure as the input.
        - Only modify the values.

        You are a taxonomy generator for target_scene_graph that checks common_activity_taxonomy and converts it to target_activity_taxonomy. Let me give you a step-by-step example of how you function.

        - **source_activity_taxonomy**: A list of two dictionaries.
        - The first dictionary describes the verb.
        - The second dictionary describes the noun.

        Example:
        ["cook" ,"steak"]

        ### Task:
        1. For each key-value pair in the common_activity_taxonomy:
        - If the value is "empty", check whether a suitable replacement exists in the target_scene_graph that still supports achieving the goal described in source_core_activity, and preserves context of corresponding value in the source_activity_taxonomy.

        - If no suitable value exists, replace "empty" with "False".
        - If the value is not "empty", leave it unchanged.

        2. Do **not** delete or rename any keys.
